# Expo WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync() iOS Simulator Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync()` from Expo doesn't return a result in the iOS simulator.  The issue only occurs on the simulator; the function works as expected on Android emulators and physical devices.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the project on an iOS simulator.
4. Observe that clicking the button does not log a result to the console, indicating `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync()` returns undefined.
5. Run the project on an Android emulator or device. The result will be properly logged.

## Expected Behavior

`WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync()` should return a result object, containing information about whether the browser opened successfully and other relevant data. This should happen consistently across all platforms, including the iOS simulator.

## Solution

The solution involves using the simulator's built-in browser and adding error handling. This provides a workaround for the issue, even though it doesn't explain the root cause.
